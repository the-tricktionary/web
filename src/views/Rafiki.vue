        The Rafiki mission is to educate children and provide everything needed
        for them to become a successful jumper and a successful student in
        school. The program connects everyone: coaches, teachers, students, and
        jumpers. Rafiki currently includes coaches and jumpers in Kenya,
        Tanzania, Morocco, South Africa, Mozambique, India, Trinidad and
        Tobago, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. If you are interested in
        participating, helping, or would like to know more you can email

          are on a team, please talk to your coaches about gathering old team
          ropes to donate.
